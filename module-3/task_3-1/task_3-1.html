    <ol>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[ When the clock is exactly 7, the if condition prints the message ( i can take the bus), and when the if condition is false, then nothing happens.]</p>
      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behavior of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>[If the "if" condition is true, you can the bus, if the if condition is false, then the "else" statement runs car to school.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>[if the wake-up time is less then 7 or greater the 8, then both conditions are false. The program goes to the else statement, and the result will be that youÂ´ll take the car.]</p>
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
    </ol>[ Zero is neither positive or negative, so the else statement will run and print "The number is zero."]<br />
